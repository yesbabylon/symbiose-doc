## Install Symbiose

### Structure 

Symbiose is a set of business packages meant to cover standard needs and duties,any business has to deal with (such as an Address Book for customer and providers, Tasks logging, HR management, Invoicing, and so on). 

See below for the full list of existing packages.

Each package contains its own classes, controllers, views and applications. Custom packages can be developped by inheriting some (of all) features from standard packages.  

All packages depends on the `core` package from eQual. That package is shipped with Symbiose at each new release. For that reason, the versions of eQual and Symbiose have to match.
